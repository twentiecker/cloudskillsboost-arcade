# Store, Process, and Manage Data on Google Cloud: Challenge Lab <br>ARC100

---

## Task 1. Create a bucket

#### Create a bucket called <BUCKET_NAME> for the storage of the photographs. Ensure the resource is created in the <REGION> region.

```bash
export REGION=<REGION>
```

```bash
export BUCKET_NAME=<BUCKET_NAME>
```

```bash
gsutil mb -l $REGION gs://$BUCKET_NAME
```

---

## Task 2. Create a Pub/Sub topic

#### Create a Pub/Sub topic called <TOPIC_NAME> for the Cloud Run function to send messages.

```bash
export TOPIC_NAME=<TOPIC_NAME>
```

```bash
gcloud pubsub topics create $TOPIC_NAME
```

---

## Task 3. Create the thumbnail Cloud Run function

#### Create a Cloud Run function <FUNCTION_NAME> that will to create a thumbnail from an image added to the <BUCKET_NAME> bucket.

#### Ensure the Cloud Run function is using the Cloud Run function environment (which is 2nd generation). Ensure the resource is created in the <REGION> region and <REGION>-c zone.

#### Enable Required Services

```bash
gcloud services enable \
  artifactregistry.googleapis.com \
  cloudfunctions.googleapis.com \
  cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
  eventarc.googleapis.com \
  run.googleapis.com \
  logging.googleapis.com \
  pubsub.googleapis.com
```

#### Set Project Variables

```bash
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
```

```bash
PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects list --filter="project_id:$PROJECT_ID" --format='value(project_number)')
```

```bash
SERVICE_ACCOUNT=$(gsutil kms serviceaccount -p $PROJECT_NUMBER)
```

#### Assign Pub/Sub Publisher Role

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
  --member serviceAccount:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT \
  --role roles/pubsub.publisher
```

#### 1. Create a Cloud Run function (2nd generation) called <FUNCTION_NAME> using Node.js 22 and setting the trigger to Cloud Storage.

#### 2. Make sure you set the Entry point (Function to execute) to <FUNCTION_NAME>.

#### 3. Add provided lab code to the index.js

```bash
nano index.js
```

#### 4. Add provided lab code to the package.json

```bash
nano package.json
```

#### Deploy the Function

```bash
export FUNCTION_NAME=<FUNCTION_NAME>
```

```bash
gcloud functions deploy $FUNCTION_NAME \
  --gen2 \
  --runtime nodejs22 \
  --entry-point $FUNCTION_NAME \
  --source . \
  --region $REGION \
  --trigger-bucket $BUCKET_NAME \
  --trigger-location $REGION \
  --max-instances 1 \
  --quiet
```

#### If you see the following error:

    ERROR: (gcloud.functions.deploy) ResponseError: status=[403], code=[Ok], message=[Validation failed for trigger projects/qwiklabs-gcp-04-0a6a1d28c7e3/locations/us-east1/triggers/wild-thumbnail-creator-483033: Permission "storage.buckets.get" denied on "Bucket \"wild-bucket-qwiklabs-gcp-04-0a6a1d28c7e3\" could not be validated. Please verify that the bucket exists and that the Eventarc service account has permission."]

or

    ERROR: (gcloud.functions.deploy) ResponseError: status=[400], code=[Ok], message=[Validation failed for trigger projects/qwiklabs-gcp-01-822619484359/locations/us-east4/triggers/travel-thumbnail-maker-167346: Invalid resource state for "": Permission denied while using the Eventarc Service Agent. If you recently started to use Eventarc, it may take a few minutes before all necessary permissions are propagated to the Service Agent. Otherwise, verify that it has Eventarc Service Agent role.]

It means the deployment failed because the Eventarc service account does not yet have permission to access your Cloud Storage bucket, or the bucket validation process hasnâ€™t completed.

#### Solution:

Wait for a few seconds to let the permissions propagate, then run the deployment command again.

---

## Task 4. Test the Infrastructure

#### To test the function, upload a JPG or PNG image into the bucket.

#### Note: You need to upload one JPG or PNG image into the bucket to verify the thumbnail was created (after creating the function successfully). Use any JPG or PNG image, or use this image https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-training/arc101/travel.jpg by downloading the image to your machine and then uploading that file to your bucket.

#### Download a test image

```bash
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-training/arc101/travel.jpg
```

#### 1. Upload a PNG or JPG image to $BUCKET_NAME bucket.

```bash
gsutil cp travel.jpg gs://$BUCKET_NAME
```

#### 2. You will see a thumbnail image appear shortly afterwards (use REFRESH in the bucket details).
