# Analyze BigQuery data in Connected Sheets: Challenge Lab

## Task 1. Open Google Sheets and connect to a BigQuery dataset

#### Log in to Sheets using the credentials provided, and connect to <filled in at lab start> > Public datasets > new_york_taxi_trips > tlc_yellow_trips_2022.

---

## Task 2. Use a formula to count rows that meet a specific criteria

#### Use a formula to count the number of taxi trips that include an airport fee.

```bash
=COUNTIF(tlc_yellow_trips_2022!airport_fee,"1")
```

---

## Task 3. Create charts to visualize BigQuery data

#### Create a pie chart to identify which payment type is most frequently used to pay the fare amount.

---

## Task 4. Extract data from BigQuery to Connected Sheets

#### Extract 10,000 rows of data from the columns pickup_datetime, dropoff_datetime, trip_distance, and fare_amount, ordered by longest trip first.

---

## Task 5. Calculate new columns to transform existing column data

#### Calculate a new column that displays the percentage of each fare amount that was used to pay toll fees (based on the toll_amount column).

```bash
=IF(fare_amount>0,tip_amount/fare_amount*100,0)
```
