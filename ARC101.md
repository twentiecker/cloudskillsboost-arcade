# Monitor and Manage Google Cloud Resources: Challenge Lab

---

## Task 1. Create a bucket

#### 1. Create a bucket named <BUCKET_NAME> in region <REGION> for the storage of the photographs.

```bash
export REGION=<REGION>
```

```bash
export BUCKET_NAME=<BUCKET_NAME>
```

```bash
gsutil mb -l $REGION gs://$BUCKET_NAME
```

#### 2. Grant Storage Object Viewer to <USER_2> on the project containing this new bucket.

---

## Task 2. Create a Pub/Sub topic

#### 1. Create a Pub/Sub topic called <TOPIC_NAME> for the Cloud Run Function to send messages.

```bash
export TOPIC_NAME=<TOPIC_NAME>
```

```bash
gcloud pubsub topics create $TOPIC_NAME
```

---

## Task 3. Create the thumbnail Cloud Run Function

#### Note: You must upload one JPG or PNG image into the bucket to verify the thumbnail was created (after creating the function successfully). Use this image https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-training/arc101/travel.jpg; download the image to your machine and then upload that file to your bucket.

#### Download an image file named wildlife.jpg from the given URL.

```bash
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-training/arc101/travel.jpg
```

#### Upload the image travel.jpg to the Cloud Storage bucket that was created earlier

```bash
gsutil cp travel.jpg gs://$BUCKET_NAME
```

#### Enable Required Services

```bash
gcloud services enable \
  artifactregistry.googleapis.com \
  cloudfunctions.googleapis.com \
  cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
  eventarc.googleapis.com \
  run.googleapis.com \
  logging.googleapis.com \
  pubsub.googleapis.com
```

#### Set Project Variables

```bash
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
```

```bash
PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects list --filter="project_id:$PROJECT_ID" --format='value(project_number)')
```

```bash
SERVICE_ACCOUNT=$(gsutil kms serviceaccount -p $PROJECT_NUMBER)
```

#### Assign Pub/Sub Publisher Role

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
  --member serviceAccount:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT \
 --role roles/pubsub.publisher
```

#### 1. Create a Cloud Run Function (2nd generation) called <CLOUD_RUN_FUNCTION_NAME> (using Node.js 22) that executes every time an object is created in the bucket <BUCKET_NAME> you created in task 1.

#### 2. Make sure you set the Entry point (Function to execute) to thumbnail and Trigger to Cloud Storage.

#### 3.a. Add provided lab code to the index.js. In line 15 of index.js replace the text REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TOPIC ID with the <TOPIC_NAME> you created in task 2.

```bash
nano index.js
```

#### 3.b. Add provided lab code to the package.json.

```bash
nano package.json
```

#### Deploy the Function

```bash
export CLOUD_RUN_FUNCTION_NAME=<CLOUD_RUN_FUNCTION_NAME>
```

```bash
gcloud functions deploy $CLOUD_RUN_FUNCTION_NAME \
 --gen2 \
 --runtime nodejs22 \
 --entry-point thumbnail \
 --source . \
 --region $REGION \
 --trigger-bucket $BUCKET_NAME \
 --allow-unauthenticated \
 --trigger-location $REGION \
 --max-instances 5 \
 --quiet
```

#### If you see the following error:

**ERROR**:`(gcloud.functions.deploy) ResponseError: status=[403], code=[Ok], message=[Validation failed for trigger projects/qwiklabs-gcp-04-0a6a1d28c7e3/locations/us-east1/triggers/wild-thumbnail-creator-483033: Permission "storage.buckets.get" denied on "Bucket \"wild-bucket-qwiklabs-gcp-04-0a6a1d28c7e3\" could not be validated. Please verify that the bucket exists and that the Eventarc service account has permission."]`

It means the deployment failed because the Eventarc service account does not yet have permission to access your Cloud Storage bucket, or the bucket validation process hasnâ€™t completed.

#### Solution:

Wait for a few seconds to let the permissions propagate, then run the deployment command again.

## Task 4. Create an alerting policy

#### 1. Create an alerting policy named Active Cloud Run Function Instances that notifies your personal email account when the number of active Cloud Run Function instances is greater than zero (0).

#### 2. For the metric, be sure to select Cloud Function > Function > Active Instances.
